WCAG
Colour scheme chosen to best suit the needs of most colour-blindness'. Tested with no-coffee extension on Google Chrome, although sizes of pages are altered due to no-coffee adding on html elements. Contrasting backgrounds and shadings on backgrounds chosen to make text stand out.

Added tab-index in order to make keyboard accessibility easier, though tab index not showing on projects tiles. Still works but invisible outline.

Backups folder outdated and unused, needs to be deleted.
